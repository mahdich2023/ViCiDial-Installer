# ViCiDial Launcher / Installer
Here we have a launcher for ViCiDial for agent desktops! Some of the features of this launcher;

- Runs in full-screen mode to prevent agents from closing the dialer down during operation.
- Agents cannot close the dialer with ALT-F4.
- This can increase data integrity and reduce the amount of dropped calls.

This Built for 32-bit and 64-bit machines.

# How to Use This
